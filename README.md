in this assignment we were asked to write a Boolean recursive static function that gets an array full of integers from the user, and then the method should return true if the input array can be divided into two different groups but equal in size equal in the sum of the two groups as well.

And we were also asked to analyze in this function the running time complexity of the program. and also to analyze the space complexity of the program. of course we was asked to do so in the minimum as possible in terms of space and time complexity.

The analysis of the running time and place complications are written in the comments above the code.
